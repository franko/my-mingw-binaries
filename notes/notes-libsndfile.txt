Using MinGW with TDM-GCC:

> ./configure --prefix=/c/fra/local

It will detect the pseudo-pkg-config installation:

checking for pkg-config... /c/fra/local/bin/pkg-config
checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... yes

The libraries flac, ogg and vorbis are detected as not present but the library can be compiled without
support for tehe corresponding file formats:

checking for flac >= 1.3.1 ... no
checking for ogg >= 1.1.3 ... no
checking for vorbis >= 1.2.3 ... no
checking for vorbisenc >= 1.2.3 ... no

configure: WARNING: *** One or more of the external libraries (ie libflac, libogg and
configure: WARNING: *** libvorbis) is either missing (possibly only the development
configure: WARNING: *** headers) or is of an unsupported version.
configure: WARNING: ***
configure: WARNING: *** Unfortunately, for ease of maintenance, the external libs
configure: WARNING: *** are an all or nothing affair.

Then compile using:

> make

It does fail. Go in the file src/Makefile and replace the variable:

MKDIR_P = /bin/mkdir -p

to use instead:

MKDIR_P = mkdir -p

A warning is emitted by the compiler about the redefinition of symbol __USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO. Normally this is harmless.

At the end of the build the libraries are located in src/.libs. The following files are used:

libsndfile-1.dll
libsndfile.a
libsndfile.dll.a

And the header file below from the src directory:

sndfile.h
